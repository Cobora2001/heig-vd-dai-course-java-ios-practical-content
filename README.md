# Java IOs - Use of this project

This repository contains the java code necessary to test the input and output via buffered (or not) readers and writers on binary and text files.

To use this program, no option is needed. Currently, results are being presented in the interface output, with the files being written in src/test/resources/. The results of a test have been copied in src/test/resources/results.txt (manually). With this, we are able to compare and draw conclusions about which writer/reader, buffered or not, is more suited for what situation.
